        <p class="clear">Hello! My name is Luke Howard and I am from England, United Kingdom. I have been a member of The Church of
            Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for 4 years now. In my free time I like to play computer games, go to the
            cinema, and hang out with friends. Currently I am studying Web Fundamentals at BYU-Idaho online. I would
            like to have a career involving website development so I am excited to learn all I can about the field.</p>
